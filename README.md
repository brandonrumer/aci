Useful python scripts when interacting with an ACI fabric. 

Use at your own risk. I'm not responible if you nuke your fabric with one of these scripts.

## Prerequisites
This varries depending on the script. Generally, the below 3rd party modules are used:
prettyprint (pprintpp)
prettytable (prettytable)
tabulate
cobraSDK
