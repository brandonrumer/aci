# ACI
Useful python scripts when interacting with an ACI fabric. 

Pay attention to the __status__ in each script. Generally speaking, if its labeled 'Production' it's a well-tested script. Still, use at your own risk. I'm not responible if you nuke your fabric with one of these scripts.

## Prerequisites
This varries depending on the script. Generally, the below 3rd party modules are used: <br>
prettyprint (pprintpp) <br>
prettytable (prettytable) <br>
tabulate <br>
cobraSDK <br>
